<p><h3>
Once upon a time, in a far-off land, there was a small village nestled in a valley surrounded by mountains. In this village, there lived a little girl named Lila who loved to explore and go on adventures.

One day, Lila set out on a journey to the top of the tallest mountain in the land. She packed some food, a blanket, and a map, and set off on her adventure. As she climbed higher and higher, she saw amazing sights - tall trees, beautiful flowers, and sparkling streams.

As the sun began to set, Lila realized she had lost her way. She looked around but everything looked the same. She was scared and didn't know what to do. Just then, she saw a small light in the distance. She walked towards it and found a tiny house made of stone. The door was open and there was an old woman sitting inside.

The woman smiled and asked Lila what brought her to her house. Lila explained her situation, and the old woman listened carefully. She then told Lila that she would guide her to the top of the mountain the next day, but that she would need to rest for the night.

Lila slept in a small bed in the corner of the room, and in the morning, the old woman gave her some food and a walking stick. They set off together, climbing up the mountain.

As they walked, the old woman pointed out interesting things that Lila had never seen before - a rare flower, a hidden stream, and a beautiful bird. They walked for hours, and finally reached the top of the mountain.

At the top, Lila was amazed by the stunning view. She saw the entire land spread out before her, and it was a sight she would never forget. She was so grateful to the old woman for guiding her there.

Lila realized that sometimes, it's okay to get lost and ask for help. She also learned that the journey is just as important as the destination. From that day on, Lila knew that she could go on any adventure and overcome any obstacle, as long as she had the courage to ask for help and enjoy the journey along the way.

The end.
